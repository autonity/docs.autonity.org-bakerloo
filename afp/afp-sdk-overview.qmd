Other than using the AFP website, you can trade also products programmatically
using the provided Python SDK.

The library is published on PyPI as the [afp-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/afp-sdk/)
package. It can be installed in a virtualenv with:

```py
pip install afp-sdk
```

The `afp` package consists of the following:

- [`afp` top-level module](afp-sdk-reference.html): High-level API for
  interacting with the Clearing System and the AutEx exchange.
- [`afp.bindings` submodule](afp-sdk-bindings-reference.html): Low-level API
  that provides typed Python bindings for the Clearing System smart contracts.

For usage examples please check the
[afp-sdk GitHub repository](https://github.com/autonity/afp-sdk).
